The user wants to add ping functionality for port 8080 to determine when to relaunch the UI. This requires:

Implementing a port checking method
Adding automatic UI relaunch logic
Handling connection states properly
Integrating with existing server management
I'll update the plan to include these requirements.

Here's the revised implementation plan:

Updated Feature Implementation:
Server Control Buttons

Start/Stop buttons connected to ServerManager
Real-time server status display
Location: ui_manager.py, server_manager.py
Port Monitoring

Add port 8080 ping method
Implement automatic UI relaunch
Location: server_manager.py
Webpage Reload

Add reload button
Implement webview reload
Location: ui_manager.py
Login Credentials

Add secure storage
Implement encryption
Location: config.py
Key Additions:
Port Monitoring

Async port checking method
Connection state tracking
Automatic UI relaunch logic
Error handling
ServerManager Updates

Add port monitoring
Expose connection state
Add relaunch triggers
Safety Considerations:
Proper async/await handling
Connection state management
Error recovery
Secure credential storage
